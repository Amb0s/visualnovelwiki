To contribute to this list, edit this page after creating an account, and place a VN entry from the top (or anywhere). 

Visual Novel is missing a guide? Click on the red link text-- this will automatically forward you to create a new page for that VN.

If you are experiencing font issues, be sure to install the Windows Japanese Fonts. Common examples are MS Gothic, Mincho, etc.

To make sure the Visual Novel link appears, press CTRL + K while highlighting the text while in editor mode (or press the anchor link symbol in the toolbar), then type in the name of the page. This won't create the page, but it will create the page link.

For example, Majikoi right below here is just simply `majikoi`, which leads to `/vns/majikoi`
